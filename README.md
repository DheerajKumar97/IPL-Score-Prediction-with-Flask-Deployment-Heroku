# Project Goal

 **This Project is to designed to predict the Score of Indian Premier League using Regression Analysis with PYTHON,FLASK,HTML,SQL**

# Project Motivation

**Every Year IPL will be going on but unfortunately in 2020 due to this pandemic everyone was in lockdown. I was Missing the IPL Match this year, and during this Lockdown i have gon through so much ideas in Machine Learning at that time i got inspired on this IPL Score Prediction concept.**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# The Python file has following sections:

## IPL Score Prediction.py

1- **Data Preprocessing** and some **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand the data

2- **Data preparation**: **Feature Engineering** and Scaling

3- **Feature Selection** using **RFE** and Model Building

4- **Regression Assumptions** Validation and **Outlier Removal**

5- **Rebuilding the Model** Post Outlier Removal: Feature Selection & RFE

6- **Removing Multicollinearity**, Model Re-evaluation and Assumptions Validation
